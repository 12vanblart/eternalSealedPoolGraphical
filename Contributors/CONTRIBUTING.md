# Contributing to Eternal Sealed

## Code of Conduct

Treat everyone with respect and be open to discussions about how to best handle an issue/request.

## Styling

### Tabs

I know it's not a popular formatting, but everything here is formatted with Tabs (length 4). Please use this formatting for files in this repository for consistency.

### Code

For `.js` and `.css` files, I request that you use [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).

For `.html` files, try to follow the general flow of the document. I'm not 100% sure what the best structure for the file is and I've been trying to clean up the file as I've been going. Recommendations and PR's for improving structuring are appreciated.

### Visuals

The primary goal for the site is to keep the UI clean and functional. Changes are welcome to be submitted, even major visual revamps. These PR's can take a lot of effort and time to review, so don't panic if it takes me a while to get back to you about these changes.

## Pull Requests

### Branch

Submit PR's to the `development` branch

### Other Details

-   When submitting a PR, include a bulleted list outlining what changes were made.
-   No PR is too small! I'd rather 5 small PR's than 1 large PR to help isolate any issues.
-   Try to keep your branch up to date over time
-   If you're having problems with understanding or implementing something, let me know and we can work through the issue! Everyone needs help now and then!
